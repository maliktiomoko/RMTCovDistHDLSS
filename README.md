# RMTCovDistHDLSS
Code for consistent estimation of the distance between covariance in the high dimensional low sample size regime using polynomial approximation
The code contain two folders: Fisher_extended which contains the files for estimation of functionals of eigenvalues of C1^{-1}C2 and Wasserstein_extended which contains the files for estimation of functionals of eigenvalues of C1C2.
Each of these folders contain a script (test_wasserstein,test_fisher) for application on synthetic data (tables given in the main paper) and a script spectral_clustering_wasserstein, for application on spectral clustering.
